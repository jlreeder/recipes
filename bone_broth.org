#+TITLE: Bone Broth
* Ingredients
- 3 beef marrow bones
- 1 celery root
- 1 onion
- 5 cloves garlic
- 10 black peppercorns
- 2 bay leaves
* Instructions
- Roast the marrow bones in the oven.
  - Don't be shy. Crank the oven to full broil and leave the bones in there until they're almost burnt. This should take between 1 hour and 90 minutes.
- Prepare the celery root, onions, and garlic.
  - These can be roughly chopped in halves or quarters.
- Combine all ingredients in a crock pot, fill with water, and roast on high for a day.
- Take out the bones, place them on a cutting board, and remove any remaining using a knife. Put the marrow aside.
- Strain the broth, keeping the liquid and removing all large solids.
- Return the marrow to the liquid, let the whole thing cool down, and store in the refrigerator or freezer.
